## Abstract
India is the worldâ€™s third fish producer in the world. It produces an average of 11 million tons of aquatic products every year. Andhra Pradesh and west Bengal stands the top states to produce marine foods in India. Aquaculture plays the decisive and integral role in developing the sunrising growth of GDP of nation. From the survey aquaculture moulds over 41 million tons of production. During 2019, the fish production increased 73% from the past decades. Since it has a lot advantage in the present trend, the production of aquaculture must be taken a keen care. This proposed system which is implemented in Raspberry Pi has covered all the maximum precautions that should be taken a proper care by monitoring the pH level, Dissolved oxygen, temperature and turbidity inside the pond automatically. And the alert notification is sent to farmer through the GSM and farmer can monitor all the sensor and actuator status through the android mobile app.
